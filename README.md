## 🎮 Game Overview

You control a fighter jet flying along a river. Your mission is to:
- Avoid or destroy **warships**, **helicopters**, and **bridges**
- Shoot missiles to eliminate enemies (1 missile at a time)
- Earn points for each object destroyed
- Cover as much distance as possible without crashing

Enemies and terrain behave dynamically:
- Helicopters move faster than ships
- Crashes with terrain or enemies end the game
- The game speeds up and generates new obstacles as you progress
